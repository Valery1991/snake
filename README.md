# Snek 🐍

Simple snake game created in TypeScript.
To run, execute `npm start`

Use the Arrow keys to move around. Eat the apples for points. The snake will grow longer with each apple consumed. If the snake collides with a wall or itself, the game is over and you will have to start over.

You can pause and resume the game as needed.
